# TodoList

This project was made with Angular. I've decided to not use some frameworks to HTML and CSS. Logical code was made with TypeScript.

## How does it works

It's a simple todo list that you can save your list to not forget about your daily tasks. It use local storage to save your list and tasks. You need just to keep using the same browser and same computer/smartphone to keep your progress in.

## Why I've done it?

It was a pratical project, that i skipped the class to try make this app by myself. The interface and logical parts, are all made by my hands and brain haha.

I'll post later the same project made following the steps from class and post down in this README. 

## Tests with Karma/Jasmine was not made
